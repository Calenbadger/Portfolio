## Bulk-RNAseq
Scripts provided here are for demonstration of coding competency. Resulting plots are not available to view in the script, but I have copies of many of the exported figures. Please contact me if you need to see the resulting plots.

## SingleCell-RNAseq
Results can be seen below code chunks for Jupyter Notebooks. The study design has been obscured, as it contains information from a proprietary study. Condition/group names have been replaced with generic descriptors. The analysis results describe data from a single-nucleus RNAseq study, not simulated data.
